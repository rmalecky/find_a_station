Summary:
--------
This app uses the borwser's built in geolocation ability and the geosearch feature of MongoDB to find the closest train station.  I used data from [PATH](http://www.panynj.gov/path/), but data from any system that publishes in the [GTFS](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/) format can be used.


Notes:
------
 * Ruby on Rails 3.2
 * Geolocation from HTML 5 
 * Geolocation search MongoDB 2.4
